# Image-Captioner

#### Implemented a model that interprets visual elements through Convolutional Neural Network and generates descriptive captions using Recurrent Neural Network.
#### Utilized VGG16 as a powerful image interpreter to extract intricate image details, effectively bridging visual and linguistic realms for meaningful captions.
#### Trained an LSTM model to craft descriptive image captions by merging it with VGG16â€™s image features, resulting in coherent and contextually relevant captions through sequential word generation.
